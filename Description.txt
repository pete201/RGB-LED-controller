The grand idea is to have a Python GUI sending serial data to a:
    Central Arduino Controller that sends RGB data via I2C to:
    Individual Arduino controlled RGB LED lamps.

In Final without I2C, i have a lamp connected to 12V with D1mini inside.  
TURN ON 12V BEFORE CONNECTING USB!!
Control via Serial port on Arduino IDE.  0,0,0 is all off.  255,255,255 is all on
